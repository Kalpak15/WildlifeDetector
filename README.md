Wildlife Detector 🦁📷



Overview
The Wildlife Detector is an AI-powered application that detects wild animals using the YOLOv8 model and provides real-time alerts. It helps organizations monitor wildlife activity and prevent human-wildlife conflicts.

Features
✅ Real-time Wild Animal Detection using YOLOv8
✅ Alert System – Sends notifications when an animal is detected
✅ Streamlit-based Frontend for user-friendly interaction
✅ API Integration for automated alerting
✅ Fast and Efficient – Works with live camera feeds and images

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
Machine Learning Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
Frontend: Streamlit
Database (Optional): MongoDB / MySQL (if needed for storing logs)
Cloud Integration: AWS / Google Cloud (optional)
